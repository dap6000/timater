# Timater - A Pomodoro Timer

API first (and likely API only) design for a timer and basic task tracker for use
with the pomodoro technique. See https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique

# Setup

This project ships with a basic containerized local environment with Docker and
Docker Compose. If your host machine has those dependancies set up you should
be able to get up ard running with:

```
$ docker compose build
…
$ docker compose up
…
```

Check the output of both commands for any errors.
